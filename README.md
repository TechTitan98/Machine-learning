# Project 5: Machine Learning and Currency Converter

## Overview
This project is an interactive web application developed using the Streamlit framework. It aims to provide users with a platform to explore various machine learning algorithms and convert currencies in real-time. The application is designed to be user-friendly and informative, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users in the fields of data science and finance.

## Features
1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
   - The application showcases a variety of machine learning algorithms, allowing users to understand their functionalities and applications. 
   - Users can explore:
     - **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression. These algorithms are used for tasks where the output is known and can be predicted based on input data.
     - **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, which help in identifying patterns and groupings in data without prior labels.
   - Each algorithm is accompanied by a brief explanation, use cases, and visualizations to enhance understanding.

2. **Live Currency Converter**: 
   - This feature allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. 
   - Users can select the currencies they wish to convert from and to, and the application will display the current conversion rate along with the converted amount.
   - The currency converter is powered by an external API that fetches live data, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date information.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework for building interactive web applications quickly and easily.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch live currency exchange rates.
